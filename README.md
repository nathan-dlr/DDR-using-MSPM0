## Overview
This project is a remake of the classic rhythm game Dance Dance Revolution in which players press buttons corresponding with arrows moving up the screen towards a target zone while a song is playing.

## Background 
This project was developed as a final project for my Intro to Embedded Systems class at UT Austin. Using a LP-MSPM0G3507, we were to implement a game in C++ that consists of buttons, a slide-pot sampled by the ADC (software developed in a previous lab) at a periodic rate according to Nyquist Theorem, moving sprites, and sounds generated by the DAC (software developed in a previous lab), and must run in at least two languages.


## Setup
This project was configured with two LP-MSPM0G3507 microcontrollers and the LCD display used was the "1.8" Color TFT LCD display with MicroSD Card Breakout - ST7735R" by Adafriut. The circuit is built on a breadboard.

### Buttons
The four buttons are configured with positive logic with a 10k resistor. They're arranged horizontally level to each other and are assigned to pins PB0-PB3. 

### Slidepot
A slidepot is connected to PB18.

### LCD 
The pin assignments for the LCD are shown below.

### SD Card
An SD card must be configured as FAT16. Music must be loaded on the SD card as a .bin file 


## Music
One microcontroller is used to play music. The function waits for a button to be pressed to begin playing music from the SD card. This function was written by Professor Valvano and utalizes the built in SysTick Timer to interrupt the main program and plays the data from the .bin file from the internal 12-bit DAC. 


## Gameplay 
The other microcontroller is used to control the gameplay. 
### Start Screen
The start screen is invoked where the user controls the slidepot to pick a language.

</p>

### Game
Once a language is selected the main gameplay starts, this also triggers the music to begin playing on the other microcontroller. Randomly generated arrows scroll up the screen, once they're aligned with the stationary arrows at the top of the screen, the user presses the button corresponding with the arrow. Movement of sprites and user inputs are handeled by the TimerG12 Periodic Interrupt. Once the ISR is finished, the main program draws to the LCD and randomly generates more arrows to be sent out.

### Results
After about a minute and a half of gameplay, the results screen is displayed along with your score, and the program ends.
